## My process
I created the basic HTML in atom.
I created <div> for each color block in the 3-fold-challenge.
From there I was able to style in CSS to look like the challenge example.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
I learned how to create 3 buttons for one site using a basic design, then customised each one in css.
I learned how and why to use position: relative; ðŸŽ‰.


```html
<div> class= sedan-suv-luxury </div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .BUTTON_GGA 1,2,3;
}

### Continued development

Continue working through the web development courses on Udemy.
practice! practice! practice!




### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://cssbuttoncreator.com/) - This helped to make the button. I really liked the preview  option for the button. I was able to see and test it out as I was creating it.
- [Example resource 2](www.udemy.com)-The App Brewery- web development bootcamp
- [Example resource 3] I used inspect in google to play around with positioning my <div>s
